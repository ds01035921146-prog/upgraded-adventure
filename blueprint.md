# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple, framework-less web application that serves as a Lotto Number Recommendation site. It is built using modern web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and is designed to be easily maintainable and extensible.

## Style, Design, and Features

*   **Layout:** A centered, clean layout for easy viewing.
*   **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts.
*   **Color Scheme:** A simple and pleasant color palette.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   A button to generate a new set of lotto numbers.
    *   A display area to show the 6 recommended lotto numbers.

## Current Task: Create Lotto Number Recommendation Site

*   **Objective:** Transform the initial "Hello World" page into a functional and visually appealing lotto number generator.
*   **Plan:**
    1.  **Update HTML (`index.html`):**
        *   Change the page title.
        *   Set up the basic structure with a title, a display area for the numbers, and a button.
    2.  **Update CSS (`style.css`):**
        *   Add styles to center the content.
        *   Style the title, number display, and the generation button to be visually appealing.
        *   Apply a modern design with shadows and good spacing.
    3.  **Update JavaScript (`main.js`):**
        *   Implement the logic to generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
        *   Create a function to update the DOM with the newly generated numbers.
        *   Add an event listener to the button to trigger the number generation.
